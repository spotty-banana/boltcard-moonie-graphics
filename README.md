This is a graphic generator for [Boltcards](https://boltcard.org). It is a NFC payment card to use with Bitcoin Lightning Network.

## Why randomized graphics for boltcards? 

I was playing with these cards and generated few different ones for friends. I thought it makes sense to have a slightly different graphics for each card. This way you don't accidentally confuse them with each other. And you have to generate separate QR codes for each card anyway so why not have a bit of fun with other graphics as well.
